                <h3><i>HEY, MY NAME IS MARTIN!</i></h3>
               <p>As a professionally trained photographer and creative visual artist, 
                   my job of telling the most beautiful love stories brings me so much 
                   fulfillment and joy. I’m hard-working, yet light-hearted. I love music, 
                   movies and most of all, my adorable family. I’m powered by love and laughter from 
                   friends who became family to me. I love luminous light, beautiful architecture and couples
                    who are deeply in love and who care about creating a magical experience for their wedding day.
                I am also appreciative for my professional clients who together we mark beautiful memories</p>
