            <h1>WEDDING</h1>
            <p>Choosing the right wedding photographer is all 
                about finding someone you connect with, whose style you love, and whose personality 
                meshes with your own. How your wedding day is remembered—it’s kind of a big deal. <br>
                We might be that person, and if you look through this site and think, “wow, I like this, they seems cool!”
                 then we would love to hear from you! We can check a big box off of your wedding 
                planning list: Capturing the moments? 
                <br> <h3> we’ve got it covered.</h3>

                <h3><i>Engagement shoot</i></h3>
                
                The best way for the bridal couple and the wedding photographer to get to 
                know each other and to experience my photographical style is an engagement 
                shoot prior to your wedding. We will choose a location with a relaxed atmosphere 
                for you. The images of an engagement shoot are obviously perfect for your wedding 
                invitation cards.

                <h3><i>Pre-wedding Meeting</i></h3>
                Your wedding is an individual and personal event and I believe 
                a meeting in person to discuss all the details before your 
                wedding day is immensely important. We will get to know each 
                other and you can tell me about your expectations and your ideas
                about imagery and style. I will definitely try, to meet all of
                your wishes and to make you an offer, which perfectly suits 
                your individual needs.

                Bridal portraits are an inherent part of every wedding. 
                For your shoot we will chose an estimated time frame of 30 
                to 60 minutes. This way we are able to create individual, unique images. 
                We will do the shoot at a spot of your choice close to your wedding location.
